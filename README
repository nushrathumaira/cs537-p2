Mysh:
	Implemented a simple shell. Used strtok to tokenize the string and then parse. Additionally string parsing took care of recognizing redirecting
	Reserved commands were handled with a simple if statement which then executed the propper function.
	Standard system commands were handled by a forked process and execve.
	Redirection was handled by closing stdout and opening a new file to the file specified.


Scheduler:
	Implemented two new syscalls in a similar fashion as the getcount method from p1
	Used argint to fetch the integer argument off the stack for the sys_settickets
	Added new variables to the proc structure to handle the tickets, the pass, and the usageCount for a given process
	Added appropriate code to allocproc to initialize the above
	Implemented a stride scheduler in place of the existing one in the kernel
